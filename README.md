# Variational Byte Code (VarexC)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chupanw/vbc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chupanw/vbc)

Variational execute Java code by lifting the byte code. Work in progress. 

Alternative to [VarexJ](https://github.com/meinicke/VarexJ) in which the interpreter is lifted. 

See [wiki](https://github.com/ckaestne/vbc/wiki/Basics) for design documentation.

VarexC's performance tuning is made possible by [JProfiler, the Java profiler](https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html)
